# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis.
##  Data Analytics Module 7 Cheryl Berger

### Overview of the analysis: 
The purpose of the analysis was to analyze the employee data for Pewlett-Hackard to determine the number of retiring employees by title and identify employees that are eligible for the mentorship progream.  These data will help Bobbys manager prepare for the potential "Silver Tsunami" that is suspected by Bobbys peers as many employees are nearing retirement age.   

### Results: 
Create a series of queries to generate the count of retiring employees by title.  
First, create a Retirement titles tagle that holds all of the titles of employees that were born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955
Then, create another query where the most recent title for each employeee is identified. 
Next, count the number of retirement-age employees by their most recent job title and exlude those that have left the company.
